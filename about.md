Venice, January 2014; from the encounter between Davide Tuberga – designer – and Andrea Reggiani – artisan ceramist – develops a new and innovative way to explore the production processes, trying so to fuse the traditional and the modern digital production approaches.
The duo creates a new extruder for ceramic and a  3d printer is redesigned: the experimentation starts.
The original project will soon develop in a larger group of specialists joining the team: a coder, Ruf; an interaction designer, Fabrizio Goglia; a graphic designer, Chiara Costantini. From this point onward the new members will enrich the project with their skills, personal approaches and professional background.
