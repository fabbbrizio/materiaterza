Macrotermes Bellicosus is the largest termite known.

In the forest, the mounds are constructed with thick walls and are dome shaped, whereas the mounds that are constructed in the savanna have thin walls and deviate from the simple dome construction to more complicated structures. Heating experiments demonstrated that this difference in structure is due to different thermal properties of each mound as a response to the unique habitats.
