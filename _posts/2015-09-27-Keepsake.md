Keepsake is an audiovisual interactive, informative and site-specific installation in a long-abandoned theatre.

The building, built in the 30's in an hospital for children, is in front of the sea on Venice area.
The installation aims to resurrect, in a fragmentary and meditative way, the sights and sounds of this places. Keepsake allows people to live a melancholic experience that, through sound and images, introduces them to the history of the theatre and its lived past.

*My tasks: Concept generation, prototyping experimentation. Visual design of the archives photos, research on the sound connecting it to the photos by programming with Processing language*.

Project made with Claudia Miliziano, Fabio Nucatolo and Rita Petrilli.
