Audiovisual interactive installation in an abandoned theatre.

The building, built in the 30's in an hospital for children, is in front of the sea on Venice area.
The installation aims to resurrect, in a fragmentary and meditative way, the sights and sounds of this places. Keepsake allows people to live a melancholic experience that, through sound and images, introduces them to the history of the theatre and its lived past.
